# OpenAI Chatter

This is a PSR-4 compliant PHP application that requires an OpenAI API key to run. This requires the PHP package manager Composer.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd /path/to/web/chat/bot/OpenAIPresent
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using Composer:

    ```
    composer install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```
    php main.php
    ```

## Configuration

You can customize the application by modifying the `src/present.php` file and adding custom prompts to the code.
