# Todo App Development Session

## Date
October 1, 2025

## Summary
Built a complete todo application in Laravel with a modern, dense UI featuring dark mode support.

## Work Completed

### 1. Initial Setup
- Started Laravel development server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Identified Laravel project location in `pt_app/` directory

### 2. Database Setup
- Created migration for `todos` table with fields:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `title` (string)
  - `description` (text, nullable)
  - `completed` (boolean, default: false)
  - `priority` (enum: low/medium/high, default: medium)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
- Ran migration successfully

### 3. Database Seeding
- Created `TodoSeeder` with 20 sample todos
- Varied priorities: 6 high, 7 medium, 7 low
- Mix of completed and incomplete tasks
- Seeded database successfully

### 4. Backend Implementation
- Created `Todo` model with:
  - Mass assignment protection via `$fillable` array
  - Boolean casting for `completed` field
- Created `TodoController` with methods:
  - `index()` - Display all todos sorted by priority, completion status, and date
  - `store()` - Create new todo with validation
  - `toggle()` - Toggle todo completion status (supports AJAX)
  - `destroy()` - Delete todo
- Set up routes:
  - `GET /` - Todo list
  - `POST /todos` - Create todo
  - `POST /todos/{todo}/toggle` - Toggle completion
  - `DELETE /todos/{todo}` - Delete todo

### 5. Frontend Implementation
- Built responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- Created dense, compact layout for better screen utilization
- Features implemented:
  - Add new todos with title, description, and priority
  - View all todos with visual priority indicators (color-coded badges)
  - Toggle todo completion with checkbox
  - Delete todos with confirmation dialog
  - Success and error message display

### 6. Dark Mode Implementation
- Added automatic dark mode detection based on system preferences
- Created manual dark mode toggle button with moon/sun icon
- Dark mode preference saved to localStorage
- All UI elements properly styled for both light and dark themes

### 7. User Experience Improvements
- Fixed page jump issue when toggling todos using AJAX
- Made UI more dense with reduced padding and font sizes
- Added comprehensive error message display for validation failures
- Smooth transitions and hover effects throughout

### 8. Bug Fixes
- Fixed validation error: Changed priority validation from `'in:candy'` to `'in:low,medium,high'`
- Fixed description not saving: Added `description` to model's `$fillable` array
- Added duplicate prevention: Added `unique:todos,title` validation rule
