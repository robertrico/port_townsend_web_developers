## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd port_townsend_web_developers

## üìù Notes

- OpenAI API examples require an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
- Laravel todo app uses SQLite by default (no additional database setup required)

## üîí Security

**IMPORTANT:** This repository does not contain any API keys or credentials. You must provide your own:

- For OpenAI examples, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API key
- Never commit `.env` files or hardcode API keys in source code
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data
